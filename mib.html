            <h2>Men in Black: International Plot Details Reveal Villain Within the MIB</h2>
            <p class="author">BY JOHN ATKINSON – ON JAN 10, 2019</p>

            <p class="drop">The threat in Men in Black: International will hit a little closer to home, as newly-released plot details revealed the film's villain will be an MIB agent. The film will serve as both a continuation and soft-reboot of the successful science-fiction franchise, which kicked off over 20 years ago with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.Directed by F. Gary Gray (Fate of the Furious), the film will reunite Thor: Ragnarok stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson as seasoned and brand new MIB agents, respectively. As revealed in the first official trailer, Thompson's character will discover the MIB's top secret headquarters after 20 years of searching. Impressed by her resolve and potential, she is recruited by Emma Thompson's Agent O, who returns to bridge the gap between the previous trilogy and the new installment. <br> Sent to London, Agent M (Thompson) will pair-up with Agent H (Hemsworth) in a globe-trotting adventure in order to solve a mystery and halt an alien threat. According to EW, the two agents will find themselves up against an enemy within the Men in Black itself. The catalyst for the movie will be the murder of an alien government official who just so happens to be killed on Agent H's watch. As a result, Agent H and Agent M will be tasked with tracking down the assassin, as well as the mole that facilitated the attack - whose existence threatens the MIB's core values.

            <p>Though it has yet to be confirmed, it's possible that the assassin will be played by - if not affiliated with - Rebecca Ferguson's (Mission: Impossible - Fallout) character. She is seen in the trailer as the three-armed alien tussling with Thompson's rookie agent. The rest of the cast will be rounded out by Liam Neeson, as the head of the Men in Black's UK branch, Rafe Spall, and the voice of Kumail Nanjiani as the alien sidekick Pawny. Though the announcement of the film was met with understandable skepticism, many were won over by the trailer - which promises a broader scope and updated action set pieces boasted by solid chemistry between the two leads. <br>Whether or not the internal villain will be alien or human remains to be seen. All things considered, however, while Ferguson will play the film's antagonist, the mole will assuredly be revealed as the "big bad" of the film. And, as for who might be pulling the strings as the mole, possible suspects include both Spall and Neeson's characters, considering neither of their characters' names have been revealed - though it could just as easily be somebody not yet introduced or revealed. Either way, a human villain plays very much into the themes teased by Thompson - regarding how the film and the franchise as a whole serves as a satire, holding a mirror up to society, while also providing escapism. Whatever the case may be, fans will only have to wait a few more months to see exactly how Men in Black: International unfolds.
