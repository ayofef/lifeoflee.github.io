            <h2>Miley Cyrus to Star in Black Mirror Season 5 Episode</h2>
            <p class="author">BY DEVIN MAINVILLE – ON DEC 12, 2018</p>

            <p class="drop">During an appearance on Howard Stern's radio show, Miley Cyrus confirmed that she'll guest star in an upcoming episode of Black Mirror. The Netflix sci-fi series has been picked up for a fifth season, but a premiere date hasn't been announced. Black Mirror, a British, anthology sci-fi series set in one dystopian universe, originally aired on Channel 4 in the UK, but was purchased by Netflix in 2014. With the move the seasons expanded from three episodes each to six, and began appealing to notable celebrities like Bryce Dallas Howard, Jesse Plemons, Leticia Wright and Jodie Foster, who directed a season four episode ("ArkAngel").<br>According to THR, the revelation that Miley Cyrus will be joining those ranks in Black Mirror’s fifth season came when Cyrus was speaking about something much more serious: losing her home in the recent Malibu wildfire. The singer mentioned that she was away from home when the fire struck because she was filming in South Africa. There had been reports that Cyrus might be featured in the new season, and while she was careful to never actually say the name of the show, Stern stated that she confirmed the news with a head nod. Because she was unsure of how much she could reveal about her involvement, she kept things vague, saying only that she plays a dynamic role with “a lot of different sides.”

            <p>Though Cyrus got her start as an actor on Disney’s Hannah Montana, she has spent the last few years focused on her music career. However, her more recent acting credits, such as Woody Allen’s Amazon series A Crisis in Six Scenes and a cameo in A Very Murray Christmas, show notable maturity from her child-star days. Joining Black Mirror, a show currently at the top of its game, could prove to be another pivotal step for her as she continues to solidify a serious career and wipe the memory of her twerking era from pop culture’s collective conscious.<br>Many fans have expressed interest in Black Mirror providing follow-ups to popular episodes like “San Junipero” and “USS Callister,” and although creator Charlie Brooker is open to exploring some ideas further, it likely won’t be during season five. So, it’s impossible to say what kind of role Cyrus may be taking on, but it’s safe to assume it'll have viewers once again re-thinking their technology addictions ­- at least for a minute.
