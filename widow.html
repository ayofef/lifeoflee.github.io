            <h2>Director Approached For Black Widow Slams Marvel Studios Model</h2>
            <p class="author">BY CHRISTOPHER FIDUCCIA – ON DEC 12, 2018</p>

            <p class="drop">Lucrecia Martel, a director that was approached for the Black Widow solo movie, is now slamming Marvel Studios for the model they use for their movies. The Argentinian filmmaker is mostly known for films like The Headless Woman and The Holy Girl. She most recently directed a film called Zama, which was based on a 1956 novel written by Antonio Di Benedetto. Scarlett Johansson had been acting for several years prior to joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but today she is most recognized for her role as Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow. The spy known as Black Widow was first seen in Tales of Suspense #52 in 1964, but made her cinematic debut in Iron Man 2 in 2010. For years, people have been wanting to see a movie that revolved around Johansson's character, and fans are finally getting their wish. Marvel Studios seems to be moving forward with a Black Widow solo movie, aiming for a release date sometime in 2020. Back in April, it was revealed that Marvel was meeting with female directors for Black Widow, but now one of those directors has some unkind words to say about Marvel movies.

            First reported by The Pioneer, Martel revealed her experience with Marvel when she spoke at Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival. Martel explained that while movie studios are now allowing more women to direct films, they still don't think female filmmakers should handle action sequences. Martel further explained, "Companies are interested in female filmmakers but they still think action scenes are for male directors. The first thing I asked them was maybe if they could change the special effects because there's so many laser lights... I find them horrible. Also the soundtrack of Marvel films is quite horrendous. Maybe we disagree on this but it's really hard to watch a Marvel film. It's painful to the ears to watch Marvel films". Martel finished speaking by saying that she would still be interested in making a Black Widow movie.

            <p>Besides Cate Shortland being hired as director for Black Widow, little is known about Johansson's solo movie. A Black Widow synopsis revolving around Romanoff's life after the USSR was circulating the internet for a while, but has since been proven to be for a film that had nothing to do with the MCU. Character breakdowns for casting purposes were also revealed a month ago, which allowed people to speculate on who the villain and other characters may be. It was also revealed recently that Jac Schaeffer was getting a writing credit on Captain Marvel, implying that Captain Marvel could have ties to the Black Widow solo movie. Even though Martel had some unkind words to say about Marvel Studios and their model for films, it's reassuring that the company is finally focusing on more female superheroes, while also hiring more female directors and writers to work on projects such as Black Widow. In the past few years, women have made strides in Hollywood, a world which has been dominated by males for decades. While Hollywood no doubt still has some work to do when it comes to making opportunities equal among all genders and races, they have at least made progress in the last few years.
